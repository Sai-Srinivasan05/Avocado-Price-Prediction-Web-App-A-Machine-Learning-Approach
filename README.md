# Avocado-Price-Prediction-Web-App-A-Machine-Learning-Approach
This project predicts avocado prices using a web app. The HTML form collects user inputs (date, region, and volume details). Flask processes the data, using a trained Random Forest model to make predictions. A Python pipeline trains the model, tunes hyperparameters, evaluates performance, and saves it for deployment.
